						Music Rhapsody Early Childhood Music
					</h2>
					<p>
						Early childhood music and movement programs seem like fun and games--and they are--, but they are also an excellent way to help children develop rhythm, balance and other skills so important to developing language, math skills, balance, coordinate, social skills, critical thinking, organization skills, creativity and confidence.  All those benefits wrapped up in an hour of song, dance, laughing, running, playing, puppets, super-cool instruments and snuggling and bonding with mom, dad or a caregiver.  It’s too much fun! 
					</p>
					<p>
						Every child is born innately, profoundly musical.  Our musicality is a gift, and with proper nurturing it grows with your child. The Music Rhapsody program, developed by internationally renowned music educator Lynn Kleiner, addresses each age and stage of childhood development. Beautiful, diverse songs, singable phrases, repetition with variety, the use of instruments, puppets and visuals all foster the love of music in an exciting and creative environment. Kid-tested and loved since 1983, it's a program that, to its core, acknowledges and values the input and creativity of each and every child.

					<h3>Simply Music Piano</h3>	
										<p>
						You love music.  Maybe you’d like to play piano—it's incredibly cool!  Are you looking for a way to keep your brain young? Or do want your child to find joy and success in creating and performing.
						My students, ages 6 to 90, start playing all kinds of music starting at their first lesson.  They have a blast with the Simply Music Piano method in class and playing at home—or anywhere.  It’s even more fun in our Piano with Friends classes.  Every lesson is in a highly self-affirming, success-oriented environment. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Students needs an acoustic piano or a weighted 61+ keys, keyboard with a pedal at home in order to practice (for example, Casio Privia series).
					</p>
					<p>
						Lessons are currently offered in Woodstock, Marietta, and Kennesaw.

						"The Simply Music method has been very accessible for my son with autism. It has been a fabulous way for him to continue to learn and grow as an individual. The best part of the program has been his instructor, Ms. Corinne. Her patience and intuitive teaching style has been a perfect fit for my special needs son. Highly recommend to any parent who has been wanting to try for their disabled child to learn an instrument. No pressure; just lots of smiles, confidence, (with all the songs he's playing) and most of all, fun!" - Linda S.
