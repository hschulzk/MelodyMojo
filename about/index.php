				Hi, I’m Corinne Schulzke.  My favorite roles are mom to 7 terrific homeschooled kids, grandma to six (and counting) and wife to a pretty amazing guy.  Music is an important part of our family life—whether attending or performing in concerts; learning new instruments; starting or rehearsing choirs; using a song to learn academics; or just gathered around the piano singing and playing (shout out to our violinists, flautists, guitarist, cellist, drummer and vocalists).
				</p>
				<p>
				I studied with excellent piano teachers in the US and Germany prior to studying special education in college and have been actively involved in accompanying since age 10, organizing musical events (vocal and instrumental ensembles, choirs, musicals, etc.) for decades and teaching piano lessons periodically over the years.

				Neil Moore’s Simply Music Piano and Lynn Kleiner’s Music Rhapsody Early Childhood Music programs intrigued me.  The more I studied them, the more impressed I was with how thoroughly accessible they make music expression for everyone while building a strong foundation in theory and performance.  I love the self-affirming celebration of learning that happens in both programs.  Simply Music Piano is everything I wanted for my children in a piano program.  I have to confess that the super cool instruments and fun puppets in the Music Rhapsody program were impossible to not fall in love with and want to share with my grandbabies and young friends!  So, of course, I had to do the intensive training to license and I’m having so much fun sharing music with friends from babies to age 89!  
				</p>

				I love being able to say to my students, “Remember when you started 4 months ago and couldn’t play anything on the piano?  Now you can play more than 20 songs and are improvising your own arrangements!  How cool is that?”  I love that my autistic students have so much to feel proud about each week—that all my students, young and young-at-heart, enjoy learning in ways that spill over to success in other areas of life.  Is it fair to call it a job when it’s this much fun?
