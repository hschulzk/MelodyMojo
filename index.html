						Early Childhood Music &amp; Movement
					</h2>
					<p>
						Every child loves to sing, dance and play! We do too!  Each week, our students develop rhythm, balance and other skills so important to developing language, math skills, balance, coordinate, social skills, critical thinking, organization skills, creativity and confidence. All that in an hour of song, dance, laughing, running, playing, puppets, super-cool instruments and snuggling and bonding. It’s too much fun! 
					</p>
					<p>
						Kid-tested and loved since 1983, internationally renowned music educator Lynn Kleiner’s Music Rhapsody fosters the love of music in an exciting, creative program that, to its core, acknowledges and values the input and creativity of every child.
					</p>
					<p>
						Classes held at <strong>Steps Dance Center</strong>, 1025 Rose Creek Drive, Suite 460, Woodstock, GA, 30189

						<h2>Simply Music Piano</h2>
						<p>
							You love music.  Maybe you’d like to play piano—it's incredibly cool!  Are you looking for a way to keep your brain young? Or do want your child to find joy and success in creating and performing.
							My students, ages 6 to 90, start playing all kinds of music starting at their first lesson.  They have a blast with the Simply Music Piano method in class and playing at home—or anywhere.  It’s even more fun in our Piano with Friends classes.  Every lesson is in a highly self-affirming, success-oriented environment. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Students needs an acoustic piano or a weighted 61+ keys, keyboard with a pedal at home in order to practice (for example, Casio Privia series).
						</p>
						<p>
							Lessons are currently offered in Woodstock, Marietta, and Kennesaw.						  	
						</p>

						<p>Everyone is musical—including you!  Prove it to yourself.</p>

								"The Simply Music method has been very accessible for my son with autism. It has been a fabulous way for him to continue to learn and grow as an individual. The best part of the program has been his instructor, Ms. Corinne. Her patience and intuitive teaching style has been a perfect fit for my special needs son. Highly recommend to any parent who has been wanting to try for their disabled child to learn an instrument. No pressure; just lots of smiles, confidence, (with all the songs he's playing) and most of all, fun!" - Linda S.

								"D-- has grown tremendously through the guidance of Ms. Corinne and the use of the Simply Music method. He is a rather young student (i.e. starting at 5 years old) but Ms. Corinne has been patient, supportive and very in-tune with his needs. As parents, we could not be happier with his progress- he is learning and loving to play the piano." - Catherine M.
